Exercise: 3.1. Your pipeline
Create now a similar deployment pipeline for a simple Node.js/Express app found [here](https://github.com/docker-hy/material-applications/tree/main/express-app).

Either clone the project or copy the files to your own repository. Set up a similar deployment pipeline (or the "first half") using GitHub Actions that was just described. Ensure that a new image gets pushed to Docker Hub every time you push the code to GitHub (you may eg. change the message the app shows).
